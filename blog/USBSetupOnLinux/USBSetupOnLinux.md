### Installing FTDI D2XX Driver
 - Download the linux d2xx driver from [FTDI](http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/D2XX.htm).
 - Open a terminal and go to the directory in which you have downloaded the above driver.
 - `tar xvzf libftftd2xx-x86_64-1.4.6.tgz`.
 - Go to the `build` directory.
 - `sudo cp libftd2xx.* /usr/local/lib`.
 - `sudo chmod 0755 /usr/local/lib/libftd2xx.so.1.4.6`.
 - `sudo ln -sf /usr/local/lib/libftd2xx.so.1.4.6 /usr/local/lib/libftd2xx.so`.
 - If you need to build the opencore NMR software from source, you also need to copy the header files. Go up the directory and copy `ftd2xx.h` and `WinTypes.h` to `/usr/local/include`.
 - Whenever you plug in the USB cable, you need to run `sudo rmmod ftdi_sio`, but in the following I describe how to let the computer do it automatically on the event of plug-in.

### (new) Plug and play on Linux (16 Oct 2018)
 - Open a terminal.
 - Run `lsusb`.
 - Find the line in the message containing `Future Technology Devices International, Ltd ...`.
 - In this line there should be a label something like: `Bus 001 Device 008: ID 0403:6010` (numbers can be different).
 - Go to `/etc/udev/rules.d/`, and make a new text file with a name of, say, `opencoreNMR.rules`.
 - One easy way to do so is `sudo vi opencoreNMR.rules`. Then, write as follows:
 ```
 ACTION="add",ATTRS{idVendor}=="0403",ATTRS{idProduct}=="6010",MODE="0666",RUN+="/sbin/rmmod ftdi_sio",OPTIONS="last_rule"
 ```
 - Be sure to use `ATTRS{idVendor}` and `ATTRS{idProduct}`. Do **not** use ATTR{idVendor} and ATTR{idProduct} (note the latter does not include "S"), otherwise I found out that `RUN+=...` does not work.
 - The points are (i) mode 666 (read and write permission for all), and (ii) implementation of `rmmod ftdi_sio`.
 - Tell the change made to the computer by: `sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && udevadm trigger`
 - Then, when the USB cable is plugged, you can have an access to the spectrometer.

### (obsolete) Non-root access to FTDI USB devices on linux
 - Open a terminal.
 - We assume that we already have disabled the default FTDI module by `sudo rmmod ftdi_sio`.
 - Run `lsusb`.
 - Find the line in the message containing `Future Technology Devices International, Ltd ...`.
 - In this line there should be a label something like: `Bus 001 Device 008: ID 0403:6010` (numbers can be different).
 - In this example, (i.e., if you got `BUS 001`), go to `/dev/bus/usb/001`, and `sudo chmod a+w ./008`.
 - Then, you should be able to implement the opencore NMR software and establish connection with the spectrometer without root privilege.
