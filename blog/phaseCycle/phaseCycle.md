# Phase Cycling with Opencore NMR
20 July 2018 Kazuyuki Takeda

 - Let me explain the difference between _phase modulation_ and _phase cycling_.
 - For simplicity, suppose a sequence in which we apply a single pulse:
```
pulse(pw; F1Amp(a), F1Phase(ph1), F1_Gate, F1_Unblank)
```

 - With this, the spectrometer emits a pulse with a width `pw`, amplitude `a`, and phase `ph1`. In addition, gate `F1\_Unblank` is activated in this example for power amplifier operation.
 - Gate `F1Phase` is used to _modulate_ the phase.
 - That is, phase modulation is used to change the phase of rf pulses.
 - Conversely, the idea of _phase cycing_ is to make a shift, _in addition to_ phase modulation, to the rf phase according to the current count of sequence repetition.
 - To implement phase cycling with Opencore NMR, we need to declare `phaselist` in the preample:
```
phaselist pl1=(ch1;x,y,-x,-y);
```

 - Here, we have defined, as an example, a phaselist `pl1` acting in channel 1 (ch1) with 4 items (x,y,-x,-y), which are equivalent to (0,90,180,270), respectively.
 - Then, we are able to use it in the pulse command as follows:
```
pulse(pw; F1Amp(a), F1Phase(ph1), pl1, F1_Gate, F1_Unblank)
```

  - When we perform repetition of the sequence, the phase of the pulse for the first count of repetition is `ph1` (=ph1+0). That for the second time is `ph1+90`, the third, `ph1+180`, and the fourth, `ph1+270`.
  - When we come to the last item of the phaselist, the next time we will be starting with the first item.

  - It is allowed to specify the phaselist alone, i.e., without phase modulation, as follows:
```
pulse(pw; F1Amp(a), pl1, F1_Gate, F1_Unblank)
```

 - No `F1Phase` appearing in the pulse command is equivalent to `F1Phase(0)`.

 - It would be important to specify the cycled _acquisition phase_ in the preample of the pulse program, as follows:
```
acqphase=x,y,-x,-y;
```
